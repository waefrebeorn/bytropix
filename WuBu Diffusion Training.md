Of course. Now that the entire pipeline is stable, we can optimize the commands for each specific stage. You're absolutely right that each step has different computational demands and training characteristics.

-   **Navigator Training:** Relatively lightweight, benefits from more epochs to learn temporal relationships. Can use a larger batch size.
-   **Denoiser Training:** Very computationally expensive (U-Net). Requires a smaller batch size to fit in VRAM but also needs more epochs to learn the complex denoising process.
-   **Construction/Generation:** These are inference steps and don't need `epochs`. Their batch size is set internally or is not relevant.

Here is the finalized, optimized command list that reflects these different requirements.

***

### Final Optimized Command List

These commands are tailored for each stage of the pipeline to balance performance, memory usage, and training quality.

#### Step 1: Train the Visual Navigator

The Navigator is relatively small, so we can use a larger batch size and more epochs to ensure it learns the video's structure well.

*   `--epochs 10`
*   `--batch-size 256`

```bash
source ~/wubumind_env/bin/activate && cd ~/HASHMIND && python3 WuBu_Funnel_Diffusionv0.1.py train_navigator --basename wubudiffusion_v0.1_bunny --video_path "bbb_sunflower_1080p_60fps_normal.mov" --epochs 10 --batch-size 256
```

---

#### Step 2: Construct the Visual Funnel Cake

This is an inference step and does not require `epochs` or `batch-size` arguments. It uses the batch size defined in the config for processing.

```bash
source ~/wubumind_env/bin/activate && cd ~/HASHMIND && python3 WuBu_Funnel_Diffusionv0.1.py construct --basename wubudiffusion_v0.1_bunny --video_path "bbb_sunflower_1080p_60fps_normal.mov"
```

---

#### Step 3: Train the Galactic Denoising U-Net

The Denoiser U-Net is large and memory-intensive. We must reduce the batch size to prevent out-of-memory errors. We'll increase the epochs to compensate for the smaller batches.

*   `--epochs 15`
*   `--batch-size 64` (or even 32 if you encounter VRAM issues)

```bash
source ~/wubumind_env/bin/activate && cd ~/HASHMIND && python3 WuBu_Funnel_Diffusionv0.1.py train_denoiser --basename wubudiffusion_v0.1_bunny --video_path "bbb_sunflower_1080p_60fps_normal.mov" --epochs 15 --batch-size 64
```

---

#### Step 4 (Optional): List Discovered Concepts

Before generating, you can see what the model "learned" from the video.

```bash
source ~/wubumind_env/bin/activate && cd ~/HASHMIND && python3 WuBu_Funnel_Diffusionv0.1.py --listemb --basename wubudiffusion_v0.1_bunny
```

---

#### Step 5: Generate an Image!

The final step. This launches the interactive console for generating images based on your prompts. It doesn't need the video, epochs, or batch size.

```bash
source ~/wubumind_env/bin/activate && cd ~/HASHMIND && python3 WuBu_Funnel_Diffusionv0.1.py generate --basename wubudiffusion_v0.1_bunny
```
