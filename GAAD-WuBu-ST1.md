## GAAD-WuBu-ST: A Golden Ratio-Infused, Adaptive, Rotation-Aware, Nested Hyperbolic Framework for Aspect-Ratio Agnostic Video Understanding

**Abstract**

Traditional video processing often relies on fixed grids or patches, struggling with diverse aspect ratios and failing to capture the organic, often φ-influenced, compositional structures found in natural scenes and motion. We introduce **GAAD-WuBu-ST (Golden Aspect Adaptive Decomposition - WuBu Spatio-Temporal Nesting)**, a novel framework that synergizes aspect-ratio agnostic spatial decomposition based on the Golden Ratio with the deep geometric processing of WuBu-ST. GAAD first decomposes each video frame into a hierarchy of salient regions using **Recursive Golden Subdivision** (creating nested squares and golden rectangles) and **Phi-Spiral Sectoring** (logarithmic spiral regions growing at φ-proportions). This hybrid partitioning yields features that are inherently multi-scale and adapt to any frame dimension without distortion. These φ-structured region features then serve as input to a specialized WuBu-S (Spatial) stack. Within WuBu-S, learnable parameters such as hyperbolic curvatures (`c_i`), inter-level rotations (`R_i`), and potentially even level descriptor initializations (`ld_i`) are inspired by or constrained by φ, embedding its principles into the geometric analysis. For instance, curvatures might follow a φ-geometric progression (`c, cφ, cφ^2, ...`), and `SO(n)` rotations in tangent space could be parameterized to favor φ-related angular relationships. The resulting φ-geometric spatial feature vectors `s_t` are then processed by WuBu-T (Temporal), which similarly can incorporate φ-inspired dynamics (e.g., in its time embeddings or flow characteristics) to model temporal evolution. This deep integration of GAAD's naturalistic spatial decomposition with WuBu-ST's adaptive, rotation-aware hyperbolic hierarchies promises a more robust, efficient, and interpretable system for tasks like motion estimation and diffusion-based video generation, inherently respecting the diverse geometries and compositions of real-world video.

### 1. Introduction: Beyond Grids – Towards Organic Video Geometry

Video processing architectures predominantly rely on uniform grid-based partitioning of frames (e.g., patches in Vision Transformers, convolutional receptive fields). While effective, this imposes a rigid Euclidean structure that may not align with the natural composition or dynamic flow within scenes. Furthermore, handling diverse video aspect ratios often involves cropping or padding, leading to information loss or distortion. The Golden Ratio (φ) and its associated logarithmic spirals, however, are pervasive in natural forms, growth patterns, and even artistic composition, suggesting an intrinsic geometric "grammar" that current models largely ignore.

Our previous work, WuBu Spatio-Temporal Nesting (WuBu-ST) [[Previous WuBu-ST Paper Ref](#ref_wubust)], introduced a deep geometric framework using nested hyperbolic spaces and explicit tangent-space rotations to model spatial hierarchies and temporal dynamics. However, its input stage typically assumed standard feature extraction.

This work proposes **Golden Aspect Adaptive Decomposition (GAAD)** as a novel front-end for WuBu-ST, creating **GAAD-WuBu-ST**. GAAD provides a multi-scale, aspect-ratio agnostic method for decomposing frames into geometrically significant regions based on φ.
1.  **Recursive Golden Subdivision:** Any rectangular frame is recursively divided into a square and a smaller golden rectangle, creating a natural hierarchy of focus.
2.  **Phi-Spiral Sectoring:** Logarithmic spiral sectors, growing at φ-proportions, emanate from focal points, capturing natural dynamic flow lines and attentional spread.
3.  **Hybrid Partitioning:** Combining these methods yields a rich set of overlapping or hierarchical regions.

Features extracted from these GAAD regions then feed into a WuBu-S stack where φ-principles are further embedded: hyperbolic curvatures might follow a φ-progression, and tangent space rotations can be parameterized or initialized to explore φ-related angular symmetries. The resulting geometrically potent spatial features are then modeled temporally by WuBu-T, which can also incorporate φ-based temporal dynamics (e.g., φ-scaled sinusoidal time embeddings).

GAAD-WuBu-ST aims to create a video processing system that:
*   Is inherently **aspect-ratio agnostic**.
*   Captures **multi-scale spatial structures** in a way that reflects natural composition.
*   Leverages the **deep geometric modeling** of WuBu-ST, now infused with φ-principles.
*   Offers potential for more **efficient and interpretable** motion and content modeling.

### 2. Golden Aspect Adaptive Decomposition (GAAD)

GAAD serves as the initial spatial analysis layer, decomposing each frame `f_t` into a set of regions `{reg_{t,k}}` whose geometry is governed by φ.

#### 2.1. Recursive Golden Subdivision
This method dissects any rectangle `(W, H)` into a primary square and a residual golden rectangle, which can be further subdivided.

```python
import math

# Golden Ratio
phi = (1 + math.sqrt(5)) / 2

def golden_subdivide_rect(x_offset, y_offset, w, h, depth=0, max_depth=3):
    """
    Recursively subdivides a rectangle into a square and a smaller golden rectangle.
    Returns a list of (level, (x, y, w_region, h_region)) tuples.
    """
    if depth >= max_depth or min(w, h) < 1: # Stop if too small or max depth reached
        return []

    regions = []
    if w == h: # It's already a square
        regions.append((depth, (x_offset, y_offset, w, h)))
        return regions # Base case for square

    if w > h: # Landscape orientation
        square_dim = h
        regions.append((depth, (x_offset, y_offset, square_dim, square_dim)))
        remaining_w = w - square_dim
        if remaining_w > 0:
            regions.extend(golden_subdivide_rect(x_offset + square_dim, y_offset, remaining_w, h, depth + 1, max_depth))
    else: # Portrait orientation or square
        square_dim = w
        regions.append((depth, (x_offset, y_offset, square_dim, square_dim)))
        remaining_h = h - square_dim
        if remaining_h > 0:
            regions.extend(golden_subdivide_rect(x_offset, y_offset + square_dim, w, remaining_h, depth + 1, max_depth))
    return regions

# Example:
# frame_width, frame_height = 1920, 1080
# subdivisions = golden_subdivide_rect(0, 0, frame_width, frame_height, max_depth=4)
# for level, (x,y,w,h_r) in subdivisions:
#     print(f"Level {level}: Rect at ({x},{y}) with size ({w}x{h_r})")
```
*   **Aspect-Ratio Agnostic:** Works for any W, H.
*   **Hierarchical:** Naturally produces regions at different scales (depth levels).
*   **Output:** A list of rectangular region coordinates `(x, y, w_region, h_region)`.

#### 2.2. Phi-Spiral Sectoring
This method defines regions based on logarithmic spirals, which often model growth patterns and visual attention paths.

```python
import numpy as np

def get_phi_spiral_sectors(frame_dims, num_arms=4, num_points_per_arm=10, 
                           a_param=0.1, # Initial radius factor related to min(W,H)
                           b_param_rad_per_rev=(np.log(phi) / (np.pi/2)) # Controls tightness, ensures phi growth per 90 deg
                           ):
    """
    Generates sectors based on logarithmic spiral arms.
    Each "sector" could be a quadrilateral defined by consecutive spiral points and their neighbors on other arms,
    or individual points can serve as centers for localized feature extraction.
    For simplicity, this returns points along the spiral arms.
    """
    W, H = frame_dims
    center_x, center_y = W / 2, H / 2
    
    initial_radius = min(W, H) * a_param
    max_radius = max(W,H) / 2 # Spiral shouldn't exceed frame boundaries much

    all_spiral_points_with_params = [] # Stores (level, arm_idx, point_idx, x, y, radius, angle)

    for arm_idx in range(num_arms):
        angle_offset = (2 * np.pi / num_arms) * arm_idx
        
        # Determine max angle for this arm to stay within bounds
        # r = initial_radius * exp(b_param_rad_per_rev * theta_local)
        # max_radius = initial_radius * exp(b_param_rad_per_rev * theta_max_local)
        # log(max_radius / initial_radius) / b_param_rad_per_rev = theta_max_local
        if initial_radius > 0 and max_radius > initial_radius and b_param_rad_per_rev > 1e-6 :
            theta_max_local = np.log(max_radius / initial_radius) / b_param_rad_per_rev
        else:
            theta_max_local = 2 * np.pi # Default to one revolution if params are tricky

        current_radius = initial_radius
        point_idx_on_arm = 0
        for theta_local in np.linspace(0, theta_max_local, num_points_per_arm):
            # radius = initial_radius * (phi**(theta_local / (np.pi / 2))) # Ensure phi growth per 90 deg
            radius = initial_radius * np.exp(b_param_rad_per_rev * theta_local) # More general form
            
            if radius > max_radius and point_idx_on_arm > 0 : # Stop if too large, ensure at least one point
                break

            actual_angle = angle_offset + theta_local
            x = center_x + radius * np.cos(actual_angle)
            y = center_y + radius * np.sin(actual_angle)

            if 0 <= x < W and 0 <= y < H: # Keep points within frame
                 all_spiral_points_with_params.append(
                     (point_idx_on_arm, arm_idx, point_idx_on_arm, x, y, radius, actual_angle)
                 )
            current_radius = radius
            point_idx_on_arm += 1
            
    # Sectors can be defined by groups of these points.
    # For example, a quadrilateral between (p_i, p_{i+1}) on arm_j and (p_i, p_{i+1}) on arm_{j+1}.
    # Or, each point (x,y) could be the center of a small patch whose size scales with 'radius'.
    # For WuBu input, we might extract features centered at these (x,y) points.
    return all_spiral_points_with_params


# Example:
# frame_width, frame_height = 1920, 1080
# spiral_points = get_phi_spiral_sectors((frame_width, frame_height), num_arms=5, num_points_per_arm=8)
# for level, arm, pt_idx, x,y,r,angle in spiral_points:
#    print(f"Level {level} (pt_idx {pt_idx} on arm {arm}): Point ({x:.1f},{y:.1f}) at radius {r:.1f}, angle {angle:.2f}")

```
*   **Dynamic Focus:** Captures central salient regions and expanding peripheral context.
*   **Natural Flow:** Aligns with how attention might scan or objects might move (e.g., curvilinear paths).
*   **Output:** A list of salient points `(x, y)` with associated scale (radius `r`) and orientation (angle `θ`). Features can be extracted from patches centered at these points, with patch size proportional to `r`.

#### 2.3. Hybrid Partitioning & Feature Extraction
The outputs of Recursive Golden Subdivision and Phi-Spiral Sectoring can be used separately or combined:
1.  **Separate Feature Sets:** Extract features from rectangular subdivision regions and, independently, from spiral-defined regions. Concatenate these feature sets.
2.  **Hierarchical Refinement:** Use large golden subdivisions to define macro-regions. Within each, initiate Phi-Spirals from their centers.
3.  **Region Primitives:** Treat each identified rectangle or spiral point/patch as a primitive.

For GAAD-WuBu-ST, we'll assume each region (rectangle from subdivision, or patch around a spiral point) has features extracted using a common backbone (e.g., a small CNN or a ViT stem):
`feat_k = CNN_stem(crop_frame_to_region_k)`
The set `{feat_k}` for a frame becomes the input to WuBu-S.

GAAD provides the φ-structured spatial sampling, which then feeds into the WuBu-ST pipeline.

**Figure 1:** Conceptual overview of GAAD-WuBu-ST framework.

#### 3.1. Frame Preprocessing with GAAD
For each frame `f_t`:
1.  Apply `golden_subdivide_rect` to get `{reg_rect_k}`.
2.  Apply `get_phi_spiral_sectors` to get `{reg_spiral_m}` (points defining centers of patches).
3.  For each region (rectangular or spiral-centered patch), extract a feature vector `feat_k` using a shared lightweight feature extractor (e.g., a few conv layers, or a patch embedding layer if regions are standardized).
4.  The collection of these region features `{feat_k}` is the input to WuBu-S for frame `f_t`. The number of regions can be variable; WuBu-S might process them like a set (e.g., using attention or pooling mechanisms after initial per-region WuBu levels).

#### 3.2. Spatial WuBu (WuBu-S) with φ-Influence
WuBu-S processes the set of GAAD region features `{feat_k}` for frame `f_t`.
*   **Input:** Each `feat_k` is mapped to the tangent space of the first hyperbolic level `H^{n_1}_{S,1}`.
*   **Nested Hyperbolic Levels (`H^{n_i}_{S,i}`):**
    *   **φ-Curvatures (`c_{S,i}`):** The learnable curvatures can be parameterized or initialized to follow a golden ratio progression: `c_{S,i} = base_c * (phi ** (i-1))`. This implies that deeper levels, processing more abstract information, have exponentially increasing (or decreasing) "hyperbolicity."
    *   **φ-Rotations (`R_{S,i}`):** The learnable `SO(n_{S,i})` tangent space rotations.
        *   If `n_{S,i}=2` (common in projective cascades), rotation is by a single angle `θ`. `θ` could be parameterized such that angles related to `2π/φ^k` or `π/φ^k` are "easier" to learn.
        *   If `n_{S,i}=3` or `4` (using quaternions), specific axes related to φ (e.g., along vectors with φ components) or rotation amounts could be prioritized in parameterization.
        This is still learnable, but the parameterization makes certain "golden" rotations part of the natural basis of transformations.
    *   **φ-Level Descriptors (`ld_{S,i}`):** The learnable `ld_{S,i}` vectors could be initialized with magnitudes or orientations related to φ or golden spiral geometry within their `n_{S,i}`-D tangent space.
    *   Other WuBu-S components (Boundary Manifolds, Flows `F_{S,i}`) operate as standard but on features derived from φ-structured regions.
*   **Output (`s_t`):** After processing all GAAD region features through several WuBu-S levels, an aggregation step (e.g., attention-based pooling, concatenation of key region features) produces the final spatial feature vector `s_t` for frame `f_t`. This `s_t` encodes the frame's content through a φ-decomposed, hyperbolically-processed lens.

#### 3.3. Temporal WuBu (WuBu-T) with φ-Influence
WuBu-T processes the sequence of spatial features `{s_t}\}$.
*   **φ-Time Embeddings:** If using sinusoidal time embeddings (common in diffusion models or Transformers for temporal position), their frequencies can be scaled by powers of φ: `ω_k = base_ω / (phi ** k)`. This is akin to your `SinusoidalPhiEmbedding()`.
*   **φ-Temporal Dynamics (Optional):** The curvatures `c_{T,j}` or rotations `R_{T,j}` within WuBu-T could also adopt φ-inspired parameterizations if the temporal dynamics themselves are hypothesized to exhibit φ-related patterns (e.g., cyclical events with φ-related periods).
*   Output: Temporal context `ctx_t`.

### 4. Mathematical Formulation (Conceptual Snippets)

1.  **GAAD Feature Extraction:**
    `f_t → GAAD(f_t) → \bigcup_k \{reg_{t,k}^{\text{rect}}\} \cup \bigcup_m \{reg_{t,m}^{\text{spiral}}\}`
    `RegionSet_t = \text{SelectRegions}(\{reg_{t,k}^{\text{rect}}\}, \{reg_{t,m}^{\text{spiral}}\})`
    For each `r \in RegionSet_t`: `feat_r = \text{CNN_stem}(\text{crop}(f_t, r))`
    `\mathcal{F}_t = \{feat_r | r \in RegionSet_t\}`

2.  **WuBu-S with φ-Curvature:**
    Curvature at level `i`: `c_{S,i} = \text{softplus}(\text{learnable_raw_c}_{S,i}) * (\text{phi}**(i-1)) + \text{min_c}` (learnable base scaled by φ-progression).
    A single `feat_r` (from `\mathcal{F}_t`) is processed:
    `v_{S,0}^{(r)} = \text{InitialProjection}(feat_r)`
    `v_{S,i}^{out,(r)} = \text{WuBuS_Level}_i(v_{S,i-1}^{out,(r)}, ..., c_{S,i}, R_{S,i}(\phi), ...)`
    `s_t = \text{Aggregate}_{r \in RegionSet_t} (v_{S,L_S}^{out,(r)})` (e.g., mean/max pool, attention)

3.  **Motion Estimation (Example Head):**
    Consider features for two corresponding GAAD regions `r` and `r'` from `f_t` and `f_{t+1}` after WuBu-S processing, `v_{S,L_S}^{out,(r,t)}` and `v_{S,L_S}^{out,(r',t+1)}`.
    Their hyperbolic distance in the final tangent space (or hyperbolic space) could indicate motion:
    `motion_{r \rightarrow r'} = \text{dist_hyperbolic}(v_{S,L_S}^{out,(r,t)}, v_{S,L_S}^{out,(r',t+1)})` (if mapped to H)
    Or in tangent space: `motion_{r \rightarrow r'} = v_{S,L_S}^{out,(r',t+1)} - R_{motion} (v_{S,L_S}^{out,(r,t)})` where `R_{motion}` is a learned transformation.

### 5. Applications with GAAD-WuBu-ST Synergy

*   **Aspect-Ratio Agnostic Motion Estimation:**
    *   GAAD regions provide natural "parcels" for tracking.
    *   WuBu-S processes these parcels geometrically. `R_{S,i}` can help canonicalize orientations of dynamic elements within GAAD regions.
    *   The hyperbolic distances or tangent space differences between corresponding processed GAAD region features across frames can robustly represent motion, regardless of initial frame W:H.
    *   Your `HyperbolicFlowBlock` would operate on these φ-structured, hyperbolically-refined features.
    ```python

            return flow_field_params # Parameters to reconstruct dense flow
    ```

*   **φ-Consistent Video Diffusion:**
    *   GAAD provides a consistent way to condition the diffusion model, irrespective of training/test video aspect ratios.
    *   The `SinusoidalPhiEmbedding` for time steps `t` in diffusion:
        ```python

                # Example frequencies based on phi

                freqs = torch.exp(
                    torch.arange(half_dim) * -(math.log(phi**2) / half_dim) 
                ) # Frequencies decrease by factor of phi^2 across embedding
                self.register_buffer("freqs", freqs)

            def forward(self, t): # t is the diffusion timestep

        ```
    *   The denoising U-Net (`HyperbolicUNet` in your sketch) would be conditioned by `s_t` (from GAAD-WuBu-S) and `ctx_t` (from WuBu-T), both of which carry φ-geometric information. The U-Net itself could have layers replaced by WuBu-style hyperbolic blocks.

### 6. Implementation Strategy & Key Innovations

*   **Incremental Build:**
    1.  Implement and test GAAD (subdivision, spirals, feature extraction from regions).
    2.  Build WuBu-S, then integrate φ-inspired curvatures/rotations. Test on GAAD region features.
    3.  Build WuBu-T with φ-time embeddings.
    4.  Combine for end-to-end tasks.
*   **Handling Variable Number of Regions:** WuBu-S needs to process a *set* of region features. This can be done by:
    *   Processing each region feature through a few shared WuBu-S levels independently.
    *   Aggregating the outputs (e.g., via learnable attention weights, max/mean pooling) to form `s_t`.
    *   Or, for a fixed max number of regions, pad and mask.
*   **Key Innovations of GAAD-WuBu-ST:**
    *   **True Aspect-Ratio Agnosticism:** GAAD's decomposition inherently adapts.
    *   **Naturalistic Multi-Scale Analysis:** φ-based regions capture salient structures more organically than grids.
    *   **Deep Geometric Semantics:** WuBu-ST provides powerful hierarchical processing, now grounded by φ-principles.
    *   **Potential Efficiency:** Focusing on φ-salient regions might be more efficient than dense patch processing.
    *   **Improved Interpretability:** Learned features relate to geometrically meaningful (φ-defined) parts of the scene.

### 7. Discussion

GAAD-WuBu-ST is a significant conceptual leap. The fusion of φ-based spatial decomposition with deep hyperbolic geometric learning is ambitious but offers compelling advantages.

*   **Strengths:**
    *   Solves aspect ratio issues fundamentally.
    *   Introduces strong, naturalistic priors (φ) into video modeling.
    *   Combines global frame structure (golden subdivisions) with local dynamic details (phi-spirals).
    *   Extends WuBu-ST's power with a more semantically rich input representation.
*   **Challenges:**
    *   **Complexity:** Both GAAD and WuBu-ST are complex; their combination is even more so.
    *   **Region Correspondence:** For motion between frames, establishing correspondence between GAAD regions across `f_t` and `f_{t+1}` is non-trivial (though spatial proximity of region centroids after global motion compensation is a start).
    *   **Computational Cost:** Extracting features from many potentially overlapping GAAD regions, then processing them through WuBu-S, could be expensive. Optimizations for sharing computation will be needed.
    *   **Learning φ-Constraints:** Ensuring that φ-inspired parameterizations (e.g., for rotations or curvatures) remain beneficial and don't overly constrain learning requires careful design. The φ-terms should guide, not rigidly dictate.

### 8. Conclusion

GAAD-WuBu-ST proposes a video understanding framework that is deeply rooted in geometric principles, from the Golden Ratio governing its initial spatial perception to the nested hyperbolic spaces shaping its hierarchical feature learning. By decomposing frames into aspect-ratio agnostic, φ-structured regions and then processing these with a WuBu-ST architecture whose own geometric parameters are φ-influenced, this framework offers a path towards more natural, robust, and potentially more efficient modeling of dynamic visual scenes. It moves beyond rigid grid assumptions, embracing the organic complexity inherent in visual data, and sets a challenging but exciting research direction for the future of geometric deep learning in video.
