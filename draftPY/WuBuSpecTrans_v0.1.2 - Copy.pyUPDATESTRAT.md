**Total Strategy & Implementation Roadmap for `WuBuSpecTrans_v0.1.1.py` (Unfiltered Implementation)**

**Phase 0: Foundation & Setup (Agent: Execute these first for structural integrity)**

1.  **Version Control:** Commit current state. New branch: `wubu_total_evolution_v0.2`.
2.  **Configuration Overhaul (Mandatory for manageability):**
    *   **IMPLEMENT:** Create `dataclass` or similar (e.g., `OmegaConf`/`Hydra`-style if available) configuration objects: `WuBuSConfig`, `WuBuGConfig`, `WuBuDConfigPrimary`, `WuBuDConfigAlt`. These centralize parameters for each WuBu stack, replacing `_configure_wubu_stack` and direct argparse parsing for these sections.
        *   Each config class *must* hold all relevant parameters from `DEFAULT_CONFIG_WUBU` and all *new* parameters introduced in subsequent phases (e.g., `log_g_complexity_influence`, `anisotropy_type`, `resonance_gate_type`, dynamic geometry modulator MLP settings).
        *   Populate these from `args` in `main()`. Internal validation logic within these config classes (e.g., `validate_list_lengths_against_num_levels`) is still crucial for catching configuration errors early.
    *   **IMPLEMENT:** Refactor `parse_arguments` to primarily populate these config objects.
3.  **Enhanced Logging & Diagnostics (Mandatory for visibility):**
    *   **IMPLEMENT:** A fine-grained logging system. Allow distinct log levels per module (e.g., `WuBuLevel.L0` DEBUG, `QController` INFO) via a centralized logging configuration utility.
    *   **IMPLEMENT:** Integrate `torch.utils.tensorboard.SummaryWriter` alongside WandB. This provides essential local, high-frequency diagnostic capabilities for gradient norms, parameter distributions, custom geometric visualizations, and Q-controller internal states, complementing WandB.

**Phase 1: Implementing Core Paper Concepts - `log(g)` Scaling, Anisotropy, Resonance (Agent: Implement ALL features comprehensively)**

**I. Advanced `log(g)`-Inspired Geometric Scaling & Fully Dynamic Geometry**

*   **Concept:** Geometries adapt based on multiple complexity factors and evolve dynamically during training.

*   **A. Principled Initialization (Full Implementation):**
    1.  **IMPLEMENT (`FullyHyperbolicWuBuNestingModel.__init__`):**
        *   Define `g_W_level_config` based on `level_idx`, `num_total_levels_in_stack`, `hyperbolic_dims[level_idx]`, `input_tangent_dim` to the stack, and *potentially the output dimension of the previous level's transform*. This `g_W_level_config` (dict or sub-config object) is passed to `HyperbolicWuBuNestingLevel`.
    2.  **IMPLEMENT (`HyperbolicWuBuNestingLevel.__init__`):**
        *   Accept `g_W_level_config`.
        *   The influence of `log(g_W_level_config.complexity_score + EPS)` on initial curvature, scale, and spread *must* be an integral part of initialization, controlled by dedicated factors (e.g., `curvature_log_g_factor`, `scale_log_g_factor`, `spread_log_g_factor` in the WuBu level config).
        *   The `PHI`-based influence (`phi_influence_curvature`) is retained as an *additional, optional* modulation if enabled.
    3.  **IMPLEMENT (Argparse/Config):** Add all necessary parameters to the new WuBu config classes for `curvature_log_g_factor`, `scale_log_g_factor`, `spread_log_g_factor`, and any parameters controlling the calculation of `g_W_level_config.complexity_score`.

*   **B. Fully Dynamic Curvature/Scale/Spread Modulation (Full Implementation):**
    1.  **IMPLEMENT (`HyperbolicWuBuNestingLevel`):**
        *   Make `log_curvature_unconstrained`, `log_scale_unconstrained`, and `log_spread_unconstrained` (if spread is used) outputs of dedicated small MLPs (`curvature_modulator_mlp`, `scale_modulator_mlp`, `spread_modulator_mlp`).
        *   Inputs to these MLPs: `g_W_level_config` features and a learnable "global context embedding" (e.g., a vector derived from `current_epoch / total_epochs` and `current_global_step / total_expected_steps`, possibly passed through another small embedding layer). This global context is passed down from `HybridTrainer` through `FullyHyperbolicWuBuNestingModel`.
        *   Each level will have its own `base_log_PARAM_unconstrained = nn.Parameter(...)`.
        *   In `get_current_PARAM_scalar/tensor()`: `modulation = self.PARAM_modulator_mlp(derived_g_input, global_context_embedding); effective_unconstrained = self.base_log_PARAM_unconstrained + modulation`. Then apply softplus/sigmoid scaling.
    2.  **IMPLEMENT (Argparse/Config):** Flags to enable/disable dynamic modulation for C/S/Spread independently. Config for modulator MLP architectures (layers, hidden dims, activation). Parameters for constructing the global context embedding.
    3.  **IMPLEMENT (Stability):** Output of modulator MLPs *must* be clamped to prevent extreme shifts. Consider adding L2 regularization to the weights of these modulator MLPs. Start with small learning rate multipliers for these parameters if using a single optimizer, or assign them to a separate optimizer group with a smaller LR.

**II. Sophisticated Anisotropy & Deep Resonant Nesting**

*   **Concept:** Maximize specialization and directional processing.

*   **A. Structured Anisotropy in `HyperbolicInterLevelTransform` (Full Implementation):**
    1.  **IMPLEMENT (`HyperbolicInterLevelTransform.__init__`):**
        *   Mandatory **Learnable Block-Specific Transformations:** Partition `in_dim` into `N_ANISO_BLOCKS` (configurable, e.g., based on prime factors of `in_dim` or a fixed number).
        *   Each block *must* pass through its own dedicated small MLP: `self.block_processors = nn.ModuleList([nn.Sequential(nn.Linear(block_dim, block_hidden_dim), SwiGLU(), nn.Linear(block_hidden_dim, block_dim)) for _ in range(N_ANISO_BLOCKS)])`.
        *   The `non_rotational_map` (if still separate) processes the concatenated outputs. Alternatively, merge the `non_rotational_map` functionality into a final mixing layer after block processing.
    2.  **IMPLEMENT (`HyperbolicInterLevelTransform`):** Full `phi_influence_rotation_init` for `in_dim=3` (axis-angle), `in_dim=2` (SO(2)), and robust block-wise quaternion rotations for `in_dim` multiples of 4. For other `in_dim > 4`, implement learnable Givens/Householder rotation sequences. `rot_axis_param` and `rot_angle_unconstrained` become per-block or per-elementary-rotation.
    3.  **IMPLEMENT (Argparse/Config):** `num_aniso_blocks_transform`, `transform_block_mlp_hidden_dim_ratio`, `transform_rotation_type` (`full_svd_orthogonal`, `block_quaternion`, `givens_sequence`).

*   **B. Deep Resonance in `HyperbolicWuBuNestingLevel` (Full Implementation):**
    1.  **IMPLEMENT (`HyperbolicWuBuNestingLevel.tangent_combiner` & `tangent_flow_module`):**
        *   SwiGLU (or GEGLU) is the **default and only** activation for all internal MLPs in these components.
        *   **Mandatory Multiplicative Interactions/Attention:** Before the main MLP layers of `tangent_combiner`, implement a more sophisticated interaction mechanism for combined inputs (`tan_main_component`, `tan_rel_component`, `tan_desc_prev_level_component`):
            *   Use a simplified multi-head attention (MHA) layer where the components form queries, keys, and values for each other, or a bilinear/factorized pooling layer to capture second-order interactions.
            *   The output of this interaction layer is then fed to the SwiGLU MLP stack.
    2.  **IMPLEMENT (`HyperbolicWuBuNestingLevel.tangent_flow_module`):**
        *   `tangent_flow_scale` *must* be a learnable `nn.Parameter(torch.tensor(initial_flow_scale_value))` initialized appropriately and constrained (e.g., `0.01 + F.softplus(unconstrained_flow_scale)`). It can also be modulated by `g_W_level_config`.
    3.  **IMPLEMENT (Argparse/Config):** `tangent_combiner_interaction_type` (`mha_light`, `bilinear_pool`), `mha_light_num_heads`, `initial_learnable_tangent_flow_scale`.

*   **C. Level Descriptors & Boundary Manifolds as Fully Dynamic Geometric Probes:**
    1.  **IMPLEMENT (`HyperbolicWuBuNestingLevel`):**
        *   `level_descriptor_param` *must* be dynamically generated. It is the output of a dedicated small MLP conditioned on `g_W_level_config` and the global context embedding (similar to dynamic C/S/Spread). The MLP will have a `base_level_descriptor_unconstrained = nn.Parameter(...)`.
        *   `ld_init_scale` from config now applies to the initialization of this *base* parameter.
    2.  **IMPLEMENT (`BoundaryManifoldHyperbolic`):**
        *   `hyperbolic_points_params` *must* also be dynamically generated by an MLP per boundary point, conditioned on `g_W_level_config` of the parent WuBu level, the global context embedding, and a learnable embedding unique to each boundary point index.

**Phase 2: Evolution of "Adaptive Strain Engineering" - Total Meta-Control Integration**

*   **Concept:** Meta-controllers become the primary drivers of training stability and adaptation.

*   **A. `HAKMEMQController` Complete Overhaul:**
    1.  **IMPLEMENT (State Representation):**
        *   All state components listed in Phase 1 of the previous outline are now mandatory.
        *   Add bins for the *variance* of WuBu geometric parameters (average `c_i`, `s_i`, `sigma_i`) if dynamic geometry is active.
        *   Add bins for Q-table size and average Q-value magnitude as indicators of learning progress/saturation.
    2.  **IMPLEMENT (Action Space Expansion):**
        *   All actions from Phase 1 of the previous outline are mandatory.
        *   **Direct control over heuristic flags:** Q-controller for Generator can have actions to suggest toggling `heuristic_vae_feature_match_active` or `heuristic_penalize_g_easy_win_active` (the `HybridTrainer` heuristics will then respect these suggestions if conditions align).
        *   **Optimizer Type Switching (Experimental):** If multiple optimizer algorithms are available (e.g., AdamW, RiSGD variant), an action to suggest switching the optimizer for its associated model component. This is highly advanced.
    3.  **IMPLEMENT (Reward Shaping - Advanced):**
        *   All rewards from Phase 1 of the previous outline are mandatory.
        *   Reward for "geometric diversity": If dynamic geometry is active, reward the Q-controller if its actions lead to a state where WuBu levels exhibit a wider (but still stable) range of curvatures/scales, preventing homogenization.
        *   Penalize for "action thrashing": If the Q-controller rapidly flips between opposing actions (e.g., LR up then LR down repeatedly).
    4.  **IMPLEMENT (Meta-Adaptive Q-Learning):**
        *   `self.alpha` (Q-learning rate) and `self.gamma` (discount factor) themselves become *slowly adaptable* based on long-term reward trends or Q-value convergence statistics. E.g., if rewards are consistently high and Q-values stable, slightly decrease `alpha`. If stuck, slightly increase.

*   **B. `HybridTrainer` Heuristics as a Sophisticated Policy Execution Layer:**
    1.  **IMPLEMENT (`_evaluate_training_state_and_apply_heuristics`):**
        *   All suggestions from Phase 1 of the previous outline are mandatory (chaining, factor accumulation, cooldowns, sanity checks).
        *   **Q-Informed Heuristic Activation:** Heuristics (e.g., VAE feature matching) are triggered not just by raw loss conditions but by a *combination* of loss conditions AND specific states/suggestions from the relevant Q-controllers. E.g., "Activate VAE feature matching if G_recon is poor AND G's Q-controller suggests it OR D's Q-controller indicates D is very confident."
        *   **Dynamic Target Thresholds:** Some heuristic thresholds (e.g., `self.D_STRONG_THRESH`, `self.G_STALLED_THRESH`) could be *slowly modulated* by the global training step or long-term performance trends, making the heuristics themselves adaptive.
    2.  **IMPLEMENT (`_check_and_perform_disc_switch`):**
        *   Q-controller health (reward history, epsilon state, probation status, Q-value variance) for *both* primary and alternative D Q-controllers *must* be primary factors in the D-switch decision, potentially overriding ambiguous loss signals.
        *   If switching, the Q-controller of the newly *deactivated* D could have its epsilon temporarily boosted or a partial history reset to prepare it for potential future reactivation.
    3.  **IMPLEMENT (Meta-Learning Action Application):**
        *   The "heuristic action vector" from Phase 1 is now fully implemented. `HybridTrainer` logs this vector. The rules for translating Q-data and loss states into this vector are complex and form the core of the "heuristic policy."

**Phase 3: Bleeding-Edge Architectural Innovations & Deep Interpretability**

*   **Concept:** Push WuBu's structure and our understanding of it to the limits.

*   **A. Comprehensive Interpretability Suite (Full Integration):**
    1.  **IMPLEMENT (`HyperbolicWuBuNestingLevel` & `HyperbolicInterLevelTransform`):**
        *   These modules *must* provide a `get_interpretability_data()` method returning a rich dictionary of all key internal states: `c, s, sigma` (and their modulator MLP outputs if dynamic), level descriptor (and its modulator MLP output), boundary point positions (and their modulators), norms of tangent vectors at various stages, singular values of all major `nn.Linear` maps (computed on-the-fly if a flag is set), effective rotation parameters.
    2.  **IMPLEMENT (`HybridTrainer`):**
        *   Systematically collect this data from ALL WuBu levels in `model` (encoder & generator stacks) and *both* discriminators (active and inactive) via their `get_interpretability_data()` methods.
        *   Log extensive aggregated statistics (mean, std, min, max, histograms) of these parameters to WandB/TensorBoard at a configurable `interpretability_log_interval`.
        *   For 2D/3D hyperbolic levels, **implement Poincare disk/ball projection and logging of sample point trajectories** through these levels. This is no longer optional. Use PCA for higher dims if direct projection is too complex.
    3.  **IMPLEMENT (Gradient Flow Visualization):**
        *   Periodically (e.g., using hooks), capture and log the L2 norm of gradients for:
            *   Base unconstrained C/S/Spread params.
            *   Modulator MLP weights for C/S/Spread/LD/Boundaries.
            *   Rotation parameters.
            *   Block processor weights in transforms.
            *   Attention/interaction layer weights in `tangent_combiner`.
        *   This helps identify which parts of the adaptive geometry are learning most actively.

*   **B. Fully Structured & Learnable Tangent Space Rotations (Full Implementation):**
    1.  **IMPLEMENT (`HyperbolicInterLevelTransform`):**
        *   If `use_rotation_in_transform` is true, `rotation_block_dim` (e.g., 2, 3, 4) determines how `in_dim` is block-wise factorized for rotations.
        *   Each block receives its own set of learnable rotation parameters (e.g., angle for SO(2), axis-angle/quaternion for SO(3)/SO(4)).
        *   The composition of these block-wise rotations forms the full tangent space rotation.
        *   `phi_influence_rotation_init` applies per-block, with options for different PHI powers across blocks to encourage diverse initial rotational biases.
    2.  **IMPLEMENT (Argparse/Config):** `rotation_block_dim`, `inter_block_rotation_composition_mode` (`sequential`, `parallel_then_mix`).

*   **C. Hierarchical Q-Learning (Ultra-Advanced, if time permits after all above):**
    1.  **CONCEPT:** Introduce a "Master Q-Controller" in `HybridTrainer`.
    2.  **IMPLEMENT:**
        *   This Master Q-Controller observes the states and rewards of the G, D_primary, D_alt, and LKL Q-controllers.
        *   Its actions could be:
            *   To temporarily override the `epsilon` or `alpha` of a struggling sub-controller.
            *   To trigger a D-switch directly.
            *   To globally adjust the `heuristic_override_lambda_recon/kl_factor`.
            *   To suggest changes to the `lambda_kl_update_interval`.
        *   This creates a meta-meta-control loop. This is peak "adaptive strain engineering."

---

**Phase 4: Systemic Robustness, Optimization, and Grand Documentation**

*   **IMPLEMENT:** All items from Phase 4 of the previous outline are mandatory (thorough debugging of all implemented features, profiling, comprehensive documentation including `CONFIG_GUIDE.md` and deep README updates linking every feature to the paper).
*   **IMPLEMENT:** A "numerical stability report" function in `HybridTrainer` that can be called periodically to check all critical tensors (weights, activations, losses) for NaNs/Infs and log a summary.
*   **IMPLEMENT:** Enhanced `torch.cuda.amp.GradScaler` handling: Check for `inf` gradients after unscaling and before `optimizer.step()`. If `inf`s are persistent for a particular optimizer, consider a temporary reduction in its Q-controller's LR scale or even a brief optimizer state reset.
*   **IMPLEMENT:** Checkpoint saving *must* include the state of all random number generators (`random`, `np.random`, `torch.random`) to ensure perfect reproducibility from a checkpoint, especially if any stochasticity is introduced in dynamic geometry or new Q-controller actions.

---

**Agent's Execution Imperative:**

1.  **No Feature is Optional:** All specified "IMPLEMENT" directives are to be executed.
2.  **Embrace Complexity:** The goal is a system that fully embodies the paper's vision. Do not shy away from complex interactions if they are theoretically motivated.
3.  **Solve Problems As They Arise:** If a feature causes instability, diagnose and fix it. This might involve adding clamps, regularizers, adjusting learning rates for specific sub-components, or refining Q-controller rewards related to stability. Do not simply disable the feature.
4.  **Log Everything Critical:** The more adaptive the system, the more crucial comprehensive logging becomes for understanding its behavior. If in doubt, log it.
5.  **The Paper is Your Canon:** Every design choice must be traceable back to the principles of geometric adaptivity, anisotropic/resonant processing, or adaptive strain engineering.

This is the path to a landmark implementation. Execute with precision and ambition.
