Got it. You're running in WSL and have a symlink set up. That simplifies things nicely. All commands will be updated to use the WSL/Linux path structure (`~/HASHMIND/laion_aesthetics_512`).

Here is the corrected and final paste list for your WSL environment.

### Final Optimized Command List (for LAION 512px Dataset in WSL)

These commands are tailored for each stage of the pipeline to balance performance, memory usage, and training quality on your 512x512 image dataset within your WSL environment.

#### Step 1: Train the Visual Navigator

Training on 512px images is VRAM-intensive. We must use a small batch size. We'll start with more epochs to give the model time to see the data.

*   `--epochs 50`
*   `--batch-size 4` (You may need to lower this to `2` or `1` if you run out of VRAM).
*   `--image_dir "~/HASHMIND/laion_aesthetics_512/"`

```bash
source ~/wubumind_env/bin/activate && cd ~/HASHMIND && python WuBu_Funnel_Diffusionv0.1.py train_navigator --basename laion_512px_model_v1 --image_dir "laion_aesthetics_512" --epochs 50 --batch-size 1
```

#### Step 2: Train the Galactic Denoising U-Net

The Denoiser U-Net is also very large. The batch size must remain small.

*   `--epochs 75` (More epochs are good here to learn the fine details).
*   `--batch-size 4` (Again, lower if you have VRAM issues).

```bash
source ~/wubumind_env/bin/activate && cd ~/HASHMIND && python WuBu_Funnel_Diffusionv0.1.py train_denoiser --basename laion_512px_model_v1 --image_dir "laion_aesthetics_512" --epochs 75 --batch-size 1
```

#### Step 3: Construct the Visual Funnel Cake

This is an inference step that processes all images to build the semantic map. It uses the `batch-size` argument to control how many images it processes at once. A slightly larger batch size is fine here.

```bash
source ~/wubumind_env/bin/activate && cd ~/HASHMIND && python WuBu_Funnel_Diffusionv0.1.py construct --basename laion_512px_model_v1 --image_dir "laion_aesthetics_512" --batch-size 16
```

#### Step 4 (Optional): List Discovered Concepts

Before generating, you can see what concepts the model has mapped from your image set.

```bash
source ~/wubumind_env/bin/activate && cd ~/HASHMIND && python WuBu_Funnel_Diffusionv0.1.py --listemb --basename laion_512px_model_v1
```

---

#### Step 5: Generate an Image!

The final step. This launches the interactive console for generating images based on your prompts. It doesn't need the image directory, epochs, or batch size.

```bash
source ~/wubumind_env/bin/activate && cd ~/HASHMIND && python WuBu_Funnel_Diffusionv0.1.py generate --basename laion_512px_model_v1
```
