# DESIGN DOCUMENT IMPLEMENTATION: Toroidal Gradient Transformation
# Author: Ascended Thinker v3 (in collaboration with Wubu)
# Realized by: Gemini
#
# This script provides a practical implementation of the Toroidal Gradient
# Transformation (TGT) for the JAX/Optax ecosystem. The core idea is to

# prevent numerical instability (inf, NaN) not by clipping gradients, but by
# mapping them from an infinite linear space onto a finite, cyclical one.

def toroidal_gradient_transform() -> optax.GradientTransformation:
    """
    Creates an Optax gradient transformation that maps gradients onto a
    bounded, cyclical space [-π, +π) to prevent numerical overflow.

    This function is the direct implementation of the TGT design document. It
    acts as a "wrapper" for gradients, ensuring that no value can ever explode
    to infinity, as the space itself is finite and wraps around.

    Returns:
        An `optax.GradientTransformation` that can be chained with other
        optimizers like adamw.

            params: The model parameters (not used in this stateless transform).

            Maps a single gradient tensor's values to the [-π, +π) interval.
            This is the core mathematical operation of TGT.

            It works in three steps, applied element-wise:
            1. (g + jnp.pi): Shifts the desired output interval [-π, π) to [0, 2π).
               This aligns the space with the standard behavior of the modulo operator.
            2. jnp.mod(..., boundary): Applies the modulo. Any value is now
               guaranteed to be within the [0, 2π) range. A very large positive
               or negative gradient is simply "wrapped" around the circle
               multiple times until it lands within this finite circumference.
            3. (... - jnp.pi): Shifts the interval back from [0, 2π) to [-π, π),
               centering it around zero. This is crucial for compatibility with
               modern optimizers like Adam, which expect gradients to be
               zero-centered.
            """
